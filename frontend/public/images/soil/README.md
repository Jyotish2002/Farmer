Drop soil images here for the Crop Recommendation soil selector.

Expected filenames (update CropRecommendation.js if you change names):
- black.jpg
- alluvial.jpg
- sandy.jpg
- loamy.jpg

Recommended size: 800x600 or similar. Web-friendly formats: .jpg or .png. Keep file names lowercase and replace spaces with hyphens if needed.

Notes:
- Files in `public/` are served at the site root, so the images will be available at `/images/soil/<name>.jpg`.
- If you'd like images bundled by the build, move them into `src/assets` and import them in `CropRecommendation.js` instead.
